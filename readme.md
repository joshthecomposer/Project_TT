# Name TBD

A cross-platform tabletop companion app that features dynamically changing music and sound to elevate your tabletop immersion, written in C (with very light use of C++) using the SDL2 library for event/window management.

This is just the skeleton for the project, more to come.

This app is planned for release on Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, and Android.
